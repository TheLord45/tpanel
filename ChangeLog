           to load a font more than once.

2022-05-15 Changed the size calculation of the setup dialog. It should now
           be useable on a damn small display too. But it still looks ugly.

           Fixed switching pages: The open popups are closed and buttons are

           correct client IP address to the AMX controller.

===============================================================================
2022-03-07 Changed the edit line "TP4 file name" into a comboBox and added
           a button to force the download of a surface file.
           The contents of the comboBox are feeded by a directory read on the
           controller. Each file with the extension "TP4" (case insensitive)
           is added as an item to the comboBox. The surface will now be
           downloaded when the selection in the comboBox changed  or the force
           button was clicked. The foce button gets a red background if the
           user wants to download the surface in any way. To be sure the user is
           asked whether the surface file should be downloaded or not.

           The second way to download a surface file is when the directory with
           the surface does not exist or contains the hidden file ".system".
           Then, if the configuration file was already configured, the surface
           is downloaded on startup of TPanel. When it finishes successfully
           the program comes up with the new surface.

2022-03-04 Fixed the look of the settings dialog on mobile devices.
           Added a feature to force the toolbar to be visible.

           the downloaded file.

           directories are not found although the contrary was the case.
           Integrates the FTP transfer into initialisation.

2022-02-25 Corrects the startpage if the program is started for the first time
           and has no surface loaded.
           Cleans up the class TTPinit.

           a TPDesign file directly from the controller.
