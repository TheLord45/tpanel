Known errors
============
* While Views are working it is poosible that when another page is shown and
  switched back to the previous page the view doesn't react any more. Here the
  framework simply forgets to send mouse events to the widget. I found no way
  to restore the internal event table to what it should be.

* On Linux with Wayland objects may look incomplete or they look like
  something is above them and hiding them partly. This is a problem with Qt6
  and Wayland. The same binary on X11 works as expected.

* Views are resetting to initial state when they are on a page drawn the second
  time.

* If there are too many objects on a page or subpage, views may become
  unresponsive. It is very likely that this is because it takes too much time
  to draw all the objects and the internal event loop of Qt6 is missing some
  events. Then some objects, like the scroll area of a view will not get any
  mouse events any more. The same can happen on any other type of object.

Documentation
=============
* Add documentation for configuration files
