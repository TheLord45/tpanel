Bargraphs
=========
* A bargraph with a slider button can't be moved free as long as a mouse press
  on the bargraph is active. This must be implemented.

Buttons
=======
* Add marquee function

Missing features
================
* Add more commands
* Implement TP5 commands where possible.
* Implement SIP phone.
* Crack the encryption of TP5 internal file.
* Crack the encryption of passwords in resources.
* Implement panel to panel audio communication.

Known errors
============
* Fix lines containing a komma. They must not end at the comma.
* On a mobile device the surface may become a destructive look if the app is
  suspended and loose network connection. In this case a new connection is
  established, which work, but the surface can't be drawn. This leads into loss
  of graphics. Seen this on a Samsung tablet Galaxy A7.

Documentation
=============
* Add documentation for configuration files
