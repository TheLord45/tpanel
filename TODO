Bargraphs
=========
* A bargraph with a slider button can't be moved free as long as a mouse press
  on the bargraph is active. This must be implemented.

Buttons
=======
* Add marquee function
* Implement text area buttons completly
* Add command ^BMF
  - Set video on off
  - Text area an input masks
  - Bargraph control

Missing features
================
* Add more commands (as always)
* Crack the encryption of TP5 internal file.
* Crack the encryption of passwords in resources.
* Implement panel to panel audio communication.
* Implemet commands to control a view
* Implement commands to control a list
* Implement a joystick

Known errors
============
* On a mobile device the surface may become a destructive look if the app is
  suspended and loose network connection. In this case a new connection is
  established, which work, but the surface can't be drawn. This leads into loss
  of graphics. Seen this on a Samsung tablet Galaxy A7.

* Sometimes the application crashes on mobile devices. It seems that the Qt
  framework may be the course. But it could be that the handling of that
  framework is wrong. This would be my fault.

* While Views are working it is poosible that when another page is shown and
  switched back to the previous page the view doesn't react any more. Here the
  framework simply forgets to send mouse events to the widget. I found no way
  to restore the internal event table to what it should be.

Documentation
=============
* Add documentation for configuration files
