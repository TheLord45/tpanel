Known errors
============
* On a mobile device the surface may become a destructive look if the app is
  suspended and loose network connection. In this case a new connection is
  established, which work, but the surface can't be drawn. This leads into loss
  of graphics. Seen this on a Samsung tablet Galaxy A7.
* The setup dialog look bad on mobile devices. It must made sure that the size
  of the input lines and the fonts has the correct size. This must be
  independent of any device.
