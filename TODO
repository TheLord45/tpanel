Missing features
================

Known errors
============
* Fix lines containing a komma. They must not end at the comma.
* On a mobile device the surface may become a destructive look if the app is

  established, which work, but the surface can't be drawn. This leads into loss
  of graphics. Seen this on a Samsung tablet Galaxy A7.
