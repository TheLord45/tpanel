# TPanel
**TPanel** is an emulation of some AMX G4 touch panels. The panels used to verify the communication protocol and the behavior were an *AMX MVP-5200i* an *AMX NXD-700Vi* and an *MST-701*.

**TPanel** was designed for *NIX desktops (Linux, BSD, â€¦) as well as Android and IOS operating systems. Currently there exists no Windows version and there probably never will.

The software uses internally the [Skia](https://skia.org) library for drawing all objects and the [Qt](https://doc.qt.io/) library to display the objects. **TPanel** is written in C++. This makes it especially on mobile platforms fast and reliable. It has the advantage to not drain the battery of any mobile device while running as fast as possible. Compared to commercial products the battery lasts up to 10 times longer.

# Full documentation
Look at the full documentation in this repository. You'll find the [reference manual](https://github.com/TheLord45/tpanel/tree/main/documentation) in three different formats:
* [PDF](https://github.com/TheLord45/tpanel/blob/main/documentation/ReferenceGuide.pdf)
* [ODT](https://github.com/TheLord45/tpanel/blob/main/documentation/ReferenceGuide.odt)

# How to compile
## Compile for Linux desktop
First download the source into a directory. Then enter the directory and type the following commands.

    $ mkdir build
    $ cd build
    $ cmake ..
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

To be able to compile the source you need the following credentials installed. Make sure you've installed the developper files of them.
- Skia
  - Download and compile the source from [Skia](https://skia.org)
- Qt 5.15 or Qt 6.x.x
- pjsip
  - Download and compile the source from [pjsip](https://www.pjsip.org)
- Expat
- Freetype

Apart from the fact that Skia and maybe pjsip is not part of your Linux distribution, the other dependencies are (for most distributions). But for Android and IOS you must cross compile them. Look at the home pages of this projects to find out how.

If everything compiled successfull and installed, you can start the application. There is a setup dialog included. It depends on the operating system of how this setup looks like.

## Compile for Android
For Android we need the [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/). In case you've not intstalled it, do it now. Additionaly you need the following libraries compiled for Android:

- [Skia](https://skia.org)
- [Qt 5.15](https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/)
- openssl (is part of NDK)
- [pjsip](https://www.pjsip.org)

As you can see, you must still use the older Qt 5.15 version because the newer Qt 6.x versions doesn't support multi architecture builds.

You can download a ready package with all the necessary libraries and header files from my [server](https://www.theosys.at/download/android_dist.tar.bz2) (~ 1Gb!). After you've downloaded this hugh file, unpack it into any directory. The file details are:

- [`android_dist.tar.bz2`](https://www.theosys.at/download/android_dist.tar.bz2)
- SHA256: `eb7f474aec318bec4af6052ac23232296fa9a9c43f0bf2640f771781d6afb1fc`

I developped **TPanel** with [QTCreator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools). Therefor I would recoment to use this tool to compile **TPanel**. All the following descriptions are for this tool. The easiest way to install it is by using the [Qt maintenance tool](https://www.qt.io/download).

Start `QTCreator` and load the project file `tpanel.pro`. You must set some things to have the correct paths. Go to the build settings of the project. Define the path where you like the binary for Android, the APK-file, to be. Expand the **Build steps** and enter into the line **Additional arguments** the following definitions:

- `SDK_PATH=</path/to/your/android/sdk>`
- `EXT_LIB_PATH=</path/to/the/distribution>` (The self compiled libraries or the distribution downloaded from my [server](https://www.theosys.at/download/android_dist.tar.bz2) )
- `EXTRA_PATH=</path/to/android/sdk/extras>`

To make clear what this means I give you an example. We assume that the Android SDK was installed into the directory `/usr/share/android-sdk-linux`. The distribution from my server (the file containing all necessary binaries for Android) was unpacked into `/home/user/distribution`. Then the line **Additional arguments** must look like:

    SDK_PATH=/usr/share/android-sdk-linux EXT_LIB_PATH=/home/user/distribution EXTRA_PATH=/usr/share/android-sdk-linux/extras

For **Build environment** check **Clear system environment**. Then click on **Details** to expand this section. With the example above in mind make sure that the following elements are there.

    ANDROID_HOME           /usr/share/android-sdk-linux
    ANDROID_NDK_HOST       linux-x86_64
    ANDROID_NDK_PLATTFORM  android-31
    ANDROID_NDK_ROOT       /usr/share/android-sdk-linux/ndk/23.1.7779620
    ANDROID_SDK_ROOT       /usr/share/android-sdk-linux
    JAVA_HOME              /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
    PATH                   /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/bin:/home/user/distribution/qt/bin:/usr/share/android-sdk-linux/ndk/23.1.7779620/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/linux-x86_64/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
    QTDIR                  /home/user/distribution/qt

Your Java distribution may be in a different location. Set the variable `JAVA_HOME` to the location on your system. Don't forget to set this path also for the variable `PATH`.

It is possible that you want to use another ndk version then *23.1.7779620*. If you want to use a newer version make sure your Qt version supports it.

I wrote the Java part for Android to work with Android 12. I use some API function available with Android 12 and above for getting the battery state and the network state. This is the reason why I set `ANDROID_NDK_PLATTFORM` to `android-31`. It is up to you to use a newer API.

With this parameters set you should be able to start the compiler. When everything finished you should find the Android binary in the **Build directory** at `android-build/build/outputs/apk/debug`.

## Compile for IOS
For IOS you need a Mac with *XCode* installed. You need also a developer accound and a signature of a developer team if you want to compile the code for a real iPhone or iPad. For details look at [Apple developer](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training).

Unfortunately I currently have no ready package with the libraries `Skia` and `pjsip` for IOS. This means that you must compile them first on you own. Once this is done, the steps are very similar to Android. The following description assumes you're using *QtCreator*.

In the settings for the project look for the section **Build steps** and the line **Additional arguments**. Enter in this line the following definitions:
- `OS=iossim` (for building it for the IOS simulator)
- `OS=ios` (for building it for an iPhone or an iPad)
- `EXT_LIB_PATH=</path/to/sdk>`
Replace `<path/to/sdk>` with the path to the previously compiled libraries *Skia* and *pjsip*.

At the line **ABIs** check both architectures (`x86-darwin-generic-mach_o-64bit` and `arm-darwin-generic-mach_o-64bit`).

In case you're building for a real iPhone or iPad you must select in the section **iOS settings** the **development team**.

In the section **Build environment** check **Clear system environment**. Then append to line **PATH**: `:/usr/bin`

That's it. Hit on compile (the hammer symbol) and start.
